# 🧠 Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of **SkillCraft Technology - Task 03**, where the objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase a **term deposit** based on their profile and past campaign interactions.

---

### 🎯 Objective  
Use a **Decision Tree Classifier** to analyze and predict customer behavior using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** provided by the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

---

### 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **File:** `bank-additional-full.csv`  
- **Instances:** 41,188  
- **Features:** 20 (e.g., age, job, education, duration, etc.)  
- **Target Variable:** `y` (yes = purchase, no = no purchase)  
- **Format:** Semicolon-separated CSV  

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Decision Tree Classifier)  

---

### 🔍 Key Steps  
- Data cleaning and one-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Binary transformation of the target variable  
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets  
- Training the decision tree model  
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Visualizing the decision tree
